# Solar system üåå ‚òÑÔ∏è ‚ú®

A small side project to practice three.js fundamentals.

Currently going through the https://threejs-journey.com/ by Bruno Simon. It's really fun and I highly recommend you check it out if you want to learn three.js

## Demo

## Potential future improvements

-   Generate galaxy/stars using particles instead of cubemap background
-   Implement lightning from the sun in some capacity
-   Make the planets selectable and show information about them
-   Better optimization of assets
